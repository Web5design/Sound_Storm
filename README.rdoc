SoundStorm is my rendition of SoundCloud, a social platform for sharing music.

I used backbone on the front end, sitting on a Rails API serving JSON. Theres a lot of JQuery/JS that went into the track player implementation - You can play, seek, comment, like, delete, etc. 

Try playing a track thru and watch users' comments pop!
